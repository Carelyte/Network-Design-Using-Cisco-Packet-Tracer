Building a secure office network
# Overview of Project
A small company with three departments (Admin, Sales and IT) needs a network with access to the internet. All departments are entitled to different VLANs to avoid inter-VLAN routing (restriction from accessing each others file) where only Admin will have access to the File Server and everyone will have access to the internet.
# Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
1. 3 PCs (one for each departments)
2. 3 switches (one for each department, where the File Server is connect to that of the Admin)
3. 4 routers
